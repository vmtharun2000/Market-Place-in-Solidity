# NFT Marketplace Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace facilitating the buying and selling of both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens. The marketplace supports both centralized and decentralized operations, offering users the flexibility to choose their preferred mode of transaction. Buyers are required to provide ERC-20 tokens for purchases, while sellers can list and sell both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens on the platform.

## Features

- **Token Standards**: Supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards for a wide range of NFT assets.
- **Decentralized Transactions**: Allows decentralized transactions where users interact directly with smart contracts for increased security and transparency.
- **Centralized Transactions**: Offers a centralized platform for users preferring a more traditional approach with added conveniences.
- **Order Management**: Makers can create, revoke, and manage their orders, providing control over their listed assets.
- **Partial Orders for ERC-1155**: Introduces the concept of partial orders for ERC-1155 tokens, allowing users to sell a fraction of their multi-fungible tokens.

## Technologies Used

- **Smart Contracts**: Implemented in Solidity to govern the rules and logic of the marketplace.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Leveraging ERC-20 tokens for seamless and secure financial transactions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes blockchain technology for transparency, immutability, and decentralized control.
- **Web3 Technologies**: Incorporates Web3.js for smooth interactions with smart contracts from the front-end.
- **Order Management System**: Implements a robust order management system to handle the creation, revocation, and partial fulfillment of orders.
